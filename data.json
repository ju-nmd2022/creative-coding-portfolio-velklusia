    "description": "Inspired by paper birds and the whispers of feathers, this piece symbolizes the unexpected. Once clicked it reveals shapes of paper birds that are beyond initial perception. For this work, I calculate the position for each cell and draw line patterns using the drawLinePattern function. The generateLines function creates an array of patterns, starting from a random point, while generateLinePattern builds a series of points within each cell. Then the drawLinePattern function connects these points to form shapes."
